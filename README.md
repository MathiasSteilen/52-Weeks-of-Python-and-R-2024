# 2024: 52 Weeks of Working with Data in  `Python` and `R`

After last year's fun and insightful challenge, I have decided to continue my journey of working with data in both `Python` and `R` in 2024. This repository will be updated weekly with the progress of the challenge. The goal is to finish one machine learning, data wrangling or data viz project every other week of 2024 in both `Python` and `R`.

Given that both languages are complements nowadays, with R being strongest for data wrangling and visualisation and Python being the predominant language for machine learning, I believe that this challenge will be incredibly useful to cement my speed and ease of gaining insights from data.
